# ws2812b_avr_driver
A ws2812b LED driver for AVR microcontrollers 

This C code was tested using an Atmega32 and was written in Atmel Studio 7. This was mostly done as a learning excercise for myself and I may or may not update the code in the future. There are surely better drivers out there but if you'd like to use this code all I ask is attribution. Thank you!
